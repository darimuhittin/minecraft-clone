Minecraft Clone Development Roadmap
================================

Current Progress:
- 16x16 world generation (static)
- Camera movement implemented

1. World Generation Improvements
------------------------------
- Expand world generation beyond 16x16
- Implement infinite terrain generation using chunks
- Add biomes (plains, forests, deserts, etc.)
- Generate caves and structures
- Implement proper height maps and noise functions for terrain

2. Block System Enhancement
-------------------------
- Add more block types (wood, sand, water, etc.)
- Implement block metadata for different states
- Add block properties (hardness, mining time, tool requirements)
- Create transparent blocks (glass, water)
- Add light propagation through blocks

3. Player Mechanics
-----------------
- Implement collision detection
- Add gravity and jumping
- Swimming mechanics
- Player inventory system
- Health and hunger systems
- Player states (walking, running, sneaking, etc.)

4. World Interaction
------------------
- Block placement and destruction
- Block selection/highlighting
- Mining mechanics with different tools
- Item pickup and dropping
- Crafting system
- Inventory management

5. Game Physics
-------------
- Fluid mechanics (water, lava)
- Falling block physics (sand, gravel)
- Particle systems (block breaking, water splashes)

6. Environmental Features
----------------------
- Day/night cycle
- Weather system
- Sky rendering
- Clouds
- Dynamic lighting

7. Entity System
--------------
- Add mobs (animals, hostile creatures)
- AI pathfinding
- Entity animation system
- Combat system
- Entity spawning rules

8. User Interface
---------------
- Inventory UI
- Crafting interface
- Health and hunger bars
- Hotbar
- Debug information (coordinates, FPS)

9. Audio System
-------------
- Background music
- Block interaction sounds
- Ambient sounds
- Entity sounds
- Player sounds

10. Optimization
--------------
- Chunk loading/unloading
- Frustum culling
- Mesh optimization
- Level of detail system
- Multi-threading for world generation

11. Save System
-------------
- World serialization
- Player data saving
- Chunk saving/loading
- Game state persistence

12. Multiplayer (Optional)
------------------------
- Client-server architecture
- Network protocol
- Player synchronization
- World state synchronization
- Chat system

13. Modding Support (Optional)
---------------------------
- Plugin system
- Resource pack support
- API for custom blocks and items
- Script support

Recommended Implementation Order:
1. Expand world generation system to handle infinite terrain using chunks
2. Implement basic physics and collision detection
3. Add block interaction (placing/breaking)
4. Implement basic inventory system
5. Add more block types and their properties
6. Progress to more complex features (entities, advanced mechanics)
